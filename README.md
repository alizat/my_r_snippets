# My R Snippets
My own R snippets. Feel free to copy and use.

I got (and will get more) inspiration from these links:

* https://github.com/gadenbuie/snippets/blob/main/r.snippets
* https://gist.github.com/moodymudskipper/3fc9aeb517a3a0435a690e0f9e06ac05
* https://dcl-workflow.stanford.edu/rstudio-snippets.html
* https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/2019/06/12/rstudio-snippets-for-markdown/
* https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_snippets.html

Note that these snippets are a work in progress, and I intend to fine-tune 
some of them further in the near future. Stay tuned.
