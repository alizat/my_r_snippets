# My R Snippets
My own R snippets. Feel free to copy and use.

I got (and will get more) inspiration from these links:

* https://github.com/gadenbuie/snippets/blob/main/r.snippets
* https://gist.github.com/moodymudskipper/3fc9aeb517a3a0435a690e0f9e06ac05
* https://dcl-workflow.stanford.edu/rstudio-snippets.html

These snippets are a work in progress, and I will keep adding and fine-tuning
them for some time. Check again every once in a while.
